<h1><b>The everchanging sky</b></h1>
<p>Clouds are beautiful expressions of weather. They are beautiful no matter what kind of weather 
they bring, whether it is a magical sunny day, with an azure sky dotted with white cotton candy tufts, or a dark and stormy unleashing of pent up 
demand for rain.Anyone can appreciate clouds from anywhere, at any time, without any special equipment.By staring at the sky, you find out that there
are no boundaries or limitations.You can see that there are no borders in space, time, or gravity; beyond this planet of ours, there is a huge space of
 unopened and unrevealed experiences. </p>
